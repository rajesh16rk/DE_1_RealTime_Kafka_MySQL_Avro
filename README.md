# DE_1_RealTime_Kafka_MySQL_Avro
Real-Time Data Processing with Confluent Kafka, MySQL, and Avro

# Objective:
This project will show how to build a Kafka producer and a consumer group that work with a MySQL database, Avro serialization, and multi-partition Kafka topics. The producer will fetch incremental data from a MySQL table and write Avro serialized data into a Kafka topic. The consumers will deserialize this data and append it to separate JSON files.
